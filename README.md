UlboraCMS 2.0 
==============

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]


[UlboraCMS 2.0](http://www.ulboracms.org) is the first production quality MEAN stack CMS and blog platform.

UlboraCMS lets you choose either Angular templates or templates built with conventional server-side template engines like EJS or Jade.

You can build multiple templates with UlboraCMS and switch between the templates through the admin screen. Templates can even contain both Angular and convention server-side technology.



This is currently beta version 2.0.0.

Release version 2.0.0 will be released later this year.
